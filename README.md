# simpleSignIn
A simple login/register interface
This is a front-end application made using React and javascript.
this is my first application. It's was made to be simple as possible. The user is able to perform login or register as a user using a valid email.

### Status: complete.
What have I learned from this project ?
One of the things I learned from this little project was the important of use Styled-components. Keep all my css class in one file is not wise at all. Using a library to deal with the form validation is a good solutio, no need to reinveted the wheel.

### How to run the application:
